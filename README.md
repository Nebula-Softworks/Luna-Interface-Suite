# As Of April 22 2025, Luna Is Officially Discontinued And is Deprecated Soon With The Release Of [Starlight](https://github.com/Nebula-Softworks/Starlight-Interface-Suite)
  
#### The Library Will Still Be Usable, ~~But Will No Longer Receive Updates (Including Bug Fixes and Patches), Meaning It Is Highly Dis-recommended.~~ On behalf of the rest of Nebula Softworks, Thank you all for being part of the amazing journey of creating Luna. But with all things in life, it isn't permanent. We have moved on from Luna, into something more - Starlight. Thank You For Your Understanding.  
#### We Will still make Luna Usable, and may give it maintanence updates every now and then
